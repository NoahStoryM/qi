Another way to structure computations.

Install it from the `Racket Package Index <https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/qi>`_.
Read `the documentation <https://docs.racket-lang.org/qi/index.html>`_ to learn more. See `the Wiki <https://github.com/drym-org/qi/wiki>`_ for community resources, events, and developer documentation.

In case the main documentation is unavailable, read the `backup docs <https://drym-org.github.io/qi/>`_.

Supporting the Project
======================

Please make any financial contributions by Venmo to ``@Sid-K``.

This project follows Attribution-Based Economics as described in `drym-org/foundation <https://github.com/drym-org/foundation>`_. Any financial contributions will be distributed to contributors and antecedents as agreed-upon in a collective process that anyone may participate in. To see the current distributions, take a look at abe/attributions.txt (TBD).

Additionally, some portion of your voluntary payment could be treated as an investment, entitling you to a share in future revenues, including payments made in the future or attributive revenue from other projects.

**NOTE**: This project is now accepting voluntary payments, and will distribute them according to ABE guidelines starting on Jan 1, 2023, to leave enough time to come up with attribution proportions and other community appraisal.

This work is "part of the world." You are free to do whatever you like with it and it isn't owned by anybody, not even the creators. Attribution would be appreciated and would help, but it is not strictly necessary nor required. If you'd like to learn more about this way of doing things and how it could lead to a peaceful, efficient, and creative world (and how you can be involved), visit `drym.org <https://drym.org>`_.
