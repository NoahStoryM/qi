qi
===
Another way to structure computations.

Install it from the `Racket Package Index <https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/qi>`_.
Read `the documentation <https://docs.racket-lang.org/qi/index.html>`_ to learn more. See `the Wiki <https://github.com/drym-org/qi/wiki>`_ for community resources, events, and developer documentation.

In case the main documentation is unavailable, read the `backup docs <https://drym-org.github.io/qi/>`_.

Supporting this Project
=======================

Please make any financial contributions by Venmo to ``@Sid-K`` and mention "Qi" in your message.

**NOTE**: This project is now accepting voluntary payments, and will distribute them according to ABE guidelines starting on Jan 1, 2023, to leave enough time to come up with attribution proportions and other community appraisal.

This project follows Attribution-Based Economics as described in `drym-org/foundation <https://github.com/drym-org/foundation>`_. Any financial contributions will be distributed to contributors and antecedents as agreed-upon in a collective process that anyone may participate in. To see the current distributions, take a look at `abe/attributions.txt <https://github.com/drym-org/qi/blob/main/abe/attributions.txt>`__ [TBD]. To see payments made into and out of the project, see the `abe <https://github.com/drym-org/qi/blob/main/abe/>`_ folder [TBD].

Additionally, if your voluntary payments exceed the agreed-upon "market price" of the project (see `price.txt <https://github.com/drym-org/qi/blob/main/abe/price.txt>`_ - TBD), that additional amount will be treated as an investment, entitling you to a share in future revenues, including payments made to the project in the future or attributive revenue from other projects.
